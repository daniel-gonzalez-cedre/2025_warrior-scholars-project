In this project, you will learn and employ a number of cryptologic techniques developed over the past few thousand years using the Python programming language. Both symmetric and asymmetric key cryptosystems will be studied. Your research project leader will assign one cryptosystem at a time in chronological order of development, and you will complete some or all of the following tasks: \n",

    "# **Introduction to Cryptography**\n",
    "What is cryptography? Cryptography is the practice and study of secure communications. In other words, the goal of cryptography is to enable two parties to communicate with each other while mitigating the risk that a third party, called an **adversary**, can successfully read the message. While **physical security** concerns itself with ensuring that an adversary will not even have the chance to intercept a message, a cryptographer assumes *a priori* that the adversary will be able to intercept the message.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus the central focus of cryptography is making a message *uninterpretable* to any third party.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us now state some defintions to lay the groundwork for the rest of this week. We will assume that all messages this week consist *only* of English letters and English words (i.e. no numbers, no non-English characters or words).\n",

    "\n",
    "You might be bracing yourself for some wild mathematics to set up our description of this cryptosystem, but relax - this is, in some sense, much easier to work with than the affine cipher (to cryptanalyze it is a different story). We will describe this cryptosystem mostly in plain English because we lack both the mathematical language to describe it precisely and the time to cover the former.\n",
    "\n",
    "Seeing an example key for the substitution cipher will tell you everything you need to know. One way to view this is that we write the alphabet down (in alphabetical order) to represent plaintext. Below that, we write down the alphabet one more time, but out of order. Such a \"mixing up\" of an ordered list is called a **permutation** of that list.\n",

    "### Discussion of Technique (Optional)\n",
    "\n",
    "The technique for cryptanalyzing the monoalphabetic substitution cipher by hand can be messy as it relies heavily on human intuition. Consequently, it is not immediately obvious how to instruct a computer to carry out an attack. We will need to make use of a class of algorithm called a [genetic algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_algorithm) to do so.\n",
    "\n",
    "A genetic algorithm is a method of selecting an optimal solution to a problem from a collection of candidate solutions. In our case, the problem is to find a substitution cipher key which decrypts (or partially decrypts) the supplied ciphertext. The candidate solutions are the set of all possible keys, and an optimal solution is a key which fully decrypts the ciphertext.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Question: Can you think of a situation in which there exists more than one key which fully decrypts ciphertext encrypted with a monoalphabetic substitution cipher?*\n",
    "\n",
    "Genetic algorithms rely on the existence and specification of a **fitness function** $f: S \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}$ which maps each candidate solution to a real number. The fitness function must do this in such a way that a candidate solution $s_1$ is \"better than\" another candidate solution $s_2$ whenever $f(s_1) > f(s_2)$. Assuming we can find a function satisfying this property, the genetic algorithm proceeds as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.   Randomly select a candidate solution $P$ from the set of all possible candidate solutions. $P$ is called the \"parent.\"\n",
    "2.   Compute $f(P)$, the parent's fitness.\n",
    "3.   Make a copy of the parent solution and alter it slightly; call this slightly-altered solution $C$ the \"child.\"\n",
    "4.   Compute $f(C)$, the child's fitness.\n",
    "5.   If $f(C) > f(P)$, resassign $C$ to $P$. In other words, the child becomes the parent. If instead $f(C) \\leq f(P)$, do nothing.\n",
    "6.   If the desired number of iterations has been reached, stop. Otherwise, go back to step 3. \n",
    "\n",
    "If the fitness function $f$ has been chosen appropriately, the parent solution will (hopefully) converge to an optimal solution given a sufficient number of iterations. So how do we apply this to cryptanalysis of the monoalphabetic substitution cipher? \n",
    "\n",
    "We first obtain lists of $\\mathbf{n}$-gram frequencies for desired values of $\\mathbf{n}$ from a very large sample of English text $\\mathcal{S}$. In our case, we'll use $\\mathbf{n} = 1, 2, 3, 4$, which are called monograms, bigrams, trigrams, and quadgrams, respectively. Let $k$ be a monoalphabetic substitution cipher key, let $d_k$ be the decryption function associated to this key, and let $c$ be the given ciphertext. Then $d_k(c)$ is the image of the ciphertext under the decryption function associated to the candidate key. Let $x$ be a particular $\\mathbf{n}$-gram. Define\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\lambda_{\\mathbf{n}}(x) = \\frac{\\textrm{number of times $x$ appears in $\\mathcal{S}$}}{\\textrm{total number of $\\mathbf{n}$-grams in $\\mathcal{S}$}}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, $\\lambda_{\\mathbf{n}}(x)$ is the proportion of $\\mathbf{n}$-grams in $\\mathcal{S}$ which are exactly $x$. Then for each $\\mathbf{n}$ and each candidate key $k$, we define a fitness function\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "f_{\\mathbf{n}}(k) = -\\sum_{x \\in d_k(c)}\\begin{cases} \\log_{10}\\left[\\lambda_{\\mathbf{n}}(x)\\right] & \\textrm{if $x \\in \\mathcal{S}$} \\\\\\\\\n",
    "-10 & \\textrm{otherwise}\n",
    "\\end{cases}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where each $x$ is taken to be an $\\mathbf{n}$-gram appearing in $d_k(c)$. The result is that $\\mathbf{n}$-grams in $d_k(c)$ which appear frequently in English text will contribute almost nothing to the value of $f_{\\mathbf{n}}(k)$, but those that appear infrequently in English text will contribute a comparatively large negative value to it. The less the value of the fitness function is, the less likely it is to be plaintext. If $d_k(c)$ is English text, it should have a value very close to zero (but will still be negative).\n",
    "\n",
    "The reason we have taken the logarithm of $\\lambda(x)$ in the sum is that very different values of $\\lambda$ could result in massive floating point arithmetic errors in our algorithm, leading to inaccurate results. For example, a computer with 8-digit precision might attempt to compute $10^{10} + 10$ and erroneously return $10^{10}$, but $\\log_{10}(10^{10}) + \\log_{10}(10) = 10 + 1 = 11$, which is exact.\n",
    "\n",
    "The sum itself is multiplied by $-1$ to ensure that candidate plaintexts which more closely resemble written English in terms of $\\mathbf{n}$-gram frequency have higher fitnesses than those that do not. "

    "The polyalphabetic substitution cipher shares much in common with its monoalphabetic cousin; indeed, the former is a generalization of the latter. You might already be familiar with a particularly famous example of the use of this cryptosystem: [the Enigma machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enigma_machine), a device used by the German military from 1926 through the end of World War II.\n",
    "\n",
    "We assume that the reader has already familiarized themselves with the monoalphabetic substitution cipher; if this is not the case, then you should go back to the previous section to acquaint yourself.\n",
    "\n",
    "To encrypt a plaintext message $p$ with the polyalphabetic substitution cipher, Alice would first select a positive integer $M$, which we call the **period** of the cipher. Then, we choose $M$ many monoalphabetic substitution cipher keys and form them into an ordered list:\n",

    "$$\n",
    "k = (k_0, k_1, k_2, \\ldots, k_{M-1})\n",

    "From now on we will index lists starting from $i = 0$ to facilitate our definitions of various things; in this case, the encryption function. Specifically, some indices will need to be made amenable to modular arithmetic, and starting with $i = 1$ is problematic. \n",
    "\n",
    "Supposing that $p_i$ is the $(i+1)^{\\textrm{th}}$ letter in the plaintext message and $c_i$ is to be the $(i+1)^{\\textrm{th}}$ letter of the ciphertext, encryption proceeds as follows:\n",

    "# The Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange\n",
    "\n",
    "The security of every cryptosystem developed through the end of the 1960s relied on the ability of two parties to exchange keys privately. This is a massive drawback. Is there a secure way to exchange cryptographic keys via a publicly accessible form of communication?\n",
    "\n",
    "This is precisely the question that mathematicians [Whitfield Diffie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whitfield_Diffie) and [Martin Hellman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Hellman) asked themselves in the early 1970s. The answer is yes, and the solution is elegant. It is named the Diffie-Hellman key exchange after its inventors and [it was published](https://ee.stanford.edu/~hellman/publications/24.pdf) in the academic journal *IEEE Transactions on Information Theory* in 1976. Actually, a British cryptographer Malcolm Williamson came up with the same solution seven years earlier, but the British government classified it. So was born the field known as **public key cryptography**.\n",
    "\n",

    "Well, first of all, it would be nice if the security was completely determined by the size of the prime and was not dependent on the security of the cryptosystem the generated key is used with. For this reason, we will employ the Vernam cipher - recall that the Vernam cipher is perfectly secret provided several conditions are met. Using the Vernam cipher will ensure that the secrecy will depend only on the size of the prime $p$. \r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "Our technique will be as follows. Assume that there are $N$ letters to be enciphered.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "1. Alice and Bob publicly agree on a large prime $p$ and a generator $g$ of $\\mathbb{Z}_p^*$. \r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "2. For each letter to be enciphered, Alice and Bob select a random integer between $0$ and $p-1$ to serve as their secret numbers. They form two lists:\r\n",

    "$$\\begin{align*}\r\n",

    "\r\n",
    "4. Finally, Alice and Bob take the least residue classes of these integers modulo $p$ and reduce them modulo $26$; say $k_i \\equiv \\left(g^{a_i b_i} \\mod p\\right) \\mod 26$. They then form a list $k$ of length $N$:\r\n",

This condition would ensure that the entries in the key would have a uniform distribution - or, at worst, they would only fail to have a uniform distribution because they didn't select their $a_i$ and $b_i$ randomly.*\r\n",
